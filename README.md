##WDI15 Project 3 - WINGMAN
###Niall Wallace, Mark Gettleson, Rob Holloway

For our group project we designed and built an app to assist would-be romeos woo their Juliet or Julian in noisy nightclubs or foreign bars:  WINGMAN.

The idea behind WINGMAN involves the user selecting prompts on their smartphone and showing them to the target of their affections.  The screen would show an ice-breaker question or complement, and provide responses that the recipient could tap.  In foreign locations or when attempting to romance someone who does not speak English, the app provides automatic translations into all major languages.

####Technology
The app is built on node.js and makes use of several node modules including:

* express
* mongoose
* bicrypt and passport
* cookieparser
* ejs
* ejs-layout

Additionally, we used **webcamjs** which is a javascript libray for use of the webcam, and the **Yandex translate** api for our translation service.

####User Journey
Imagine you're in a busy, hot, pumping, LOUD nightclub.  You're on the prowl.  And then... there he/she is, cutting some funky shapes on the dancefloor.  A vision of perfection.  He/she must be yours.  

But how to strike up a conversation?  It's so loud in here, and you'll probably fluff your lines and make an idiot of yourself anyway.  

Enter WINGMAN!

Like a panther (with hands.  And a phone.  And pockets) you pull out your smartphone and spool up the WINGMAN app.  In an instant you've signed in, and, sexily approaching your prey, you click the GO button:

You attract his or her attention with a gentle tap on their shoulder.  Showing them the screen, you ask them their name:

![Enter Your Name](/Users/roho1/ga_wdi/homework/week9/project_3/wingman/name.jpg)

Chris enters his/her name.  He or she smiles.  You could be in here!

WINGMAN then presents you with a list of interactions:

You'd like to buy Chris a drink, so you click the drink icon.  You show Chris your phone again:

![Would you like a drink?](/Users/roho1/ga_wdi/homework/week9/project_3/wingman/drink1.jpg)

Chris is thirsty and borderline alcoholic.  He/she immediately clicks "Yes!".  This brings up a list of drinks:

Chris is mad for gin, so taps the appropriate button.  Turning the screen back to yourself, you see the result:

![Gin please!](/Users/roho1/ga_wdi/homework/week9/project_3/wingman/drink3.jpg)

Yes, thanks to WINGMAN you're in!  Get yourself to the bar immediately, and make it a double!

Other options include:

* Would you like a cigarette
